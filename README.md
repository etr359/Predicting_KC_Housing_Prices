## Data

Data for this analysis is of home sales in Kings County, Washington over the past decade. The target variable is the sale price. Continuous features  included in the data set include the square footage of the living area, the lot, the basement and the above ground living area, as well as the mean square footage of the living area and lot of the nearest 15 neighbors.  The year the home was built and the year of renovation is included. Geographic information includes the latitue, the longitude and the zip code.  Categorical features of the home include the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and floors, whether the home is on the waterfront, and qualitative ratings of the home's amentities including the quality of the view, the condition of the home and the archetectural grade.

## Methods

Descriptive statistics and histograms were created for continuous variables to assess the distribution and evaluate measures of central tendency and dispersion.  Value counts were calculated for all categorical variables.  Scatterplots or box plots (as appropriate) were assessed between the sale price, and continuous and categorical features to visualize associations to determine cutpoints for the creation of categorical variables and to determine whether linear transformations of continuous variables were necessary. Bivariable tests of association (ANOVA and Pearon's Correlation Coefficient) were calculated to aid in this process.  An example boxplot between the number of bedrooms and the home price is displayed below in figure 1.

A series of linear regressions were estimated on an 80:20 train-test split to assess model fit through a stepwise process.  A baseline conceptually derived model based on EDA was constructed and iterations including engineered features consisting of logarithmic transformations polynomials, and interactions.  Overfitting was assessed by comparing the RMSE of the model on the training and testing data.  Model prediction was assessed by comparing the adjusted R-sqaure and the RMSE of the test set model between models.

As a sensitivity analysis we constructed a model using a purely data driven approach.  To complete this we contructed all dummy variables for all possible categorical values, and constructed all second order polynomials and interactions possible given the variables using the PolynomialFeatures class in sklearn.preprocessing.  We selected the 110 best variables using the SelectKBest class in sklearn.feature_selection using the F-test as our criteria.  One hundred ten was chosen follwing the rule of thumb to avoid the curse of dimensionality - the square root of the training split rounded down to 110.

## Results

Our final model had an adjusted R-squared of 0.649.  The RMSE of the training set was 207993.96 and the RMSE of the test set was 203547.00.

## Conclusions

Our final model explains 65% of the variance in sale price of the home.  Improved prediction would likely be generated by utilizing the geographic information to incorporate information on school districts, and median income at the census block group level.
